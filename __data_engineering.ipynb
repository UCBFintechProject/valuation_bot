Many tickers were missing so much info, that there were dropped altogether. We trimmed as little as possible and filled a few remaining slots with thier columns' mean (which would skew things, but we're low on options).\n",

This was done in an earlier step sin there were only 15 compamnies that had a non-null MarketCap. So we just generated it from the othe roclumns for the remaining 104 companies.\n"
