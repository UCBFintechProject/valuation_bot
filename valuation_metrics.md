- Price-to-Earnings Ratio - The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a metric that helps investors determine the market value of a stock compared to the company's earnings. In short, the P/E ratio shows what the market is willing to pay today for a stock based on its past or future earnings.

- Price-to-Book Ratio - The price-to-book ratio or P/B ratio measures whether a stock is over or undervalued by comparing the net value (assets - liabilities) of a company to its market capitalization. Essentially, the P/B ratio divides a stock's share price by its book value per share (BVPS). The P/B ratio is a good indication of what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's net value.

- Debt-to-Equity Ratio - The debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is a stock metric that helps investors determine how a company finances its assets. The ratio shows the proportion of equity to debt a company is using to finance its assets.

- Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash produced by a company through its operations, minus the cost of expenditures. In other words, free cash flow is the cash left over after a company pays for its operating expenses and capital expenditures (CapEx).

- PEG Ratio - The price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a modified version of the P/E ratio that also takes earnings growth into account. The P/E ratio doesn't always tell you whether or not the ratio is appropriate for the company's forecasted growth rate.

### Asset-based approaches
An asset-based approach totals up all of the investments in the company to determine the value of the business. When you choose an asset-based approach, all of your investments will be totaled up in one of two ways:
- A going concern asset-based approach, also known as book value, will review your company’s balance sheet, list the business’ total assets and subtract its total liabilities.
- A liquidation asset-based approach is used when determining the liquidation value or net cash value of your business if all your assets were sold and liabilities paid off. This is a common approach for business owners who are looking to sell their business or get out from under it.

### Earning value approaches
The earning value approach evaluates businesses based on their ability to produce wealth in the future. This approach is generally used for a company that is looking to buy or merge with another company. There are two types of earning value approaches:
- Capitalizing past earnings. This method reports the company’s usage of past earnings, normalizes them, then multiplies the expected normalized cash flows by a capitalization factor. This rate is what a reasonable purchaser would expect on their investment of the business.
- Discounted future earnings. This approach averages the trend of predicted future earnings for the company, then divides it by the same capitalization factor.

### Market value approaches
When assessing the market value of their business, owners establish what the business is worth based on similar businesses that have recently been sold. This sometimes leads to a business being under- or overvalued.

If your business and its assets are worth about 5 million but similar companies have been sold in the 2-million range, you may lose money on the sale. Earning value approaches are the most popular means of business valuations, but that doesn’t mean it’s the right choice for you. In fact, a combination of these three methods may be the best way to get a fair and accurate value for your company. The best way to get the fairest valuation is to hire an experienced business valuator to advise you on the best methods of how to evaluate your business.
